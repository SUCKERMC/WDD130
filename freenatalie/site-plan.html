        INTRO PARAGRAPH
        People will come to my website to find information about Natalie Ryan’s involvement with the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA). Natalie is a trans woman who has been competing in professional disc golf in the women’s division since (year)_____ and has been sponsored by Neptune Discs. Recently, there has been a lot of controversy about her participation and the PDGA has taken a stance that does not allow Natalie to continute to play in the women’s professional division any longer. 
     </p>
       <P> ABOUT ME 
        I play disc golf on an amateur level, competing in tournaments around the Pacific Northwest each season. One of the things that I’ve enjoyed about disc Golf is the friendliness and inclusiveness of the community. Disc golf is a sport that anyone can enjoy. It makes me sad that anyone would feel like they are being excluded or pushed out from something that they are passionate about. I know people have a lot of questions and concerns about transgender athletes participating in sports. As a fan of Natalie and a fellow PDGA member, I hope to provide information that will help to answer some of these questions and show my support for Natalie Ryan and other transgender athletes who wish to participate in disc golf.
        </P>

        PDGA MEMBER OPINION
Several months ago, the PDGA sent out a questionnaire to it’s members asking for their opinion on the subject of transgender athletes. I believe that misinformation and fear caused many members to express that they were against transgender participation. I would like PDGA members to be aware of what is going on and to have all of the information that they need in order to be educated about the issues and voice their opinion based on fact instead of fear. I hope that people will come to my site because I am not a transgender athlete, but I am PDGA member who is concerned about this issue,  so I hope that I can provide a viewpoint that is neutral and answers the questions that people have.

      <h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
      <p>
        
        The most common concerns that people seem to have are regarding fairness between having someone who identities as a gender that is different than the one they were assigned (or identified by) at birth. People wonder if an athlete who has a different physical makeup than other athletes in their division would have an unfair advantage, or if medical measures being taken in the athlete’s transition process might give them an advantage as well. There is also a common concern that athletes will purposely (and maliciously) change their gender for the sole purpose of gaining a physical advantage over the other athletes in their division.

      </ul>
      <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
      <p>
        The PDGA has sited a specific study to justify banning Natalie from participation in the division that she has been playing in at the professional level for years. However, this study is not widely recognized as an authoritative source and there are many other studies that show contrary information. I feel that the PDGA should use the Olympics standards for transgender athletes as a model, which has strict requirements for eligibility that take into account hormone levels and other important factors, but still allow transgender athletes to participate if they meet the qualifications.
