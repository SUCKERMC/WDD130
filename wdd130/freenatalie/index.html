                <p>I play disc golf on an amateur level, competing in tournaments around the Pacific Northwest each
                    season. One of the things that I’ve enjoyed about disc Golf is the friendliness and inclusiveness of
                    the community. Disc golf is a sport that anyone can enjoy. It makes me sad that anyone would feel
                    like they are being excluded or pushed out from something that they are passionate about. I know
                    people have a lot of questions and concerns about transgender athletes participating in sports. As a
                    fan of Natalie and a fellow PDGA member, I hope to provide information that will help to answer some
                    of these questions and show my support for Natalie Ryan and other transgender athletes who wish to
                    participate in disc golf.</p>

            <h3>LEARN MORE</h3>
            <P>
                Come to my website to find information about Natalie Ryan’s involvement with the Professional Disc Golf
                Association (PDGA). Natalie is a trans woman who has been competing in professional disc golf in the
                women’s division since 2018 and has been sponsored by Neptune Discs. Recently, there has been a lot of
                controversy about her participation and the PDGA has taken a stance that does not allow Natalie to
                continue to play in the women’s professional division any longer.</p>
        </div>
    
            <div>
                <p>Several months ago, the PDGA sent out a questionnaire to it’s members asking for their opinion on the
                    subject of transgender athletes. I believe that misinformation and fear caused many members to
                    express that they were against transgender participation. I would like PDGA members to be aware of
                    what is going on and to have all of the information that they need in order to be educated about the
                    issues and voice their opinion based on fact instead of fear. I hope that people will come to my
                    site because I am not a transgender athlete, but I am PDGA member who is concerned about this issue,
                    so I hope that I can provide a viewpoint that is neutral and answers the questions that people have.
